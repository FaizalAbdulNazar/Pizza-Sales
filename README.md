# Pizza-Sales
I found this dataset from Kaggle. This is about Pizza Sales of the year 2015.
Using SQL, I found out the Total Revenue, Average Order value and Total Pizzas sold and much more.
With the help of SQL I figured which is the busiest day of the week and which quarter of the year saw the most sales etc.
I also tried to find out what are the best and the worst selling pizzas.
After this I used Power BI to create a dashboard showcasing the informations that I found.
Here using Power BI I created two dashboards, one dedicated for the details about pizza sales, total orders, total revenue etc.
The second one is about the top 5 and the bottom 5 pizzas. Presenting how much sales they got and the revenue gained from these.
I have attached the SQL Queries, Dataset and the Power BI dashboards.
